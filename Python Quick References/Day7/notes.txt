machine learning
----------------------
it also called as predictive analysis
when we want to predict future based on historical data 
ML it a subset of AI - artificial intellegence (mimicing human behaviour)

three types of machine learning
1. Supervised machine learning - where we know the column headings. we have labeled data
                               - humidity/ rainfall/ temp and crop yield
							   - humidity/ rainfall/ temp - independent vars
							   - crop yield - dependent var
							     eg CY = 3.2* humidty + 1.3* rainfall + 8.9 Temp + 4.5
							   - Linear Regression
							   - Logistic Regression
							   - Decision Trees
							   - Random Forest
							   - Naive Bayes classifier
							   
2. Unsupervised machine learning - we donot have column headings - data is unlabeled
                                 - clustering algorithms belongs to unspervised ML
								 - we find the hidden features in the data and cluster it based on similarities
								 - KMeans clustering
								 - CMeans clustering
								 - Agglomerative clustering
								 
3. Reinforcement learning - learning with experience/ slow and gradual learning
                          - manless car - Tesla
						  - Pavlov Dog theory - 
						  
						  
Linear Regression
-------------------------
is statistical way of finding the relationship between independent and dependent vars
in a form of straight line

Positive Linear Regression - increase in independent var increases the dependent var and vice vers
Negative Linear Regression - increase in independent var decreases dependent var and vice versa

we have a library sklearn - which is used for machine learning
sklearn library has sublibrary datasets which contains historical datasets

boston - housing dataset - 13 independent variables 
                         - 1 dependent var called price
		
	
	
you have 1 million rows and 5000 columns
we save the model on the disk and reuse it to predict again and again - this process is known as pickling
