call by reference
-----------------------
whenever we pass lists/tuples and dictionaries to a function they are passed by reference
their memory address get passed

sort - is used to sort the values of a list there and then in the original list. cannot be used with tuples
sorted() - returns the sorted values in a form of list. it can be used both in case of lists and tuples.

question:- create a function to take input from the user marks obtained in maths.
           ask user how many marks he wants to evaluate and take those many marks in list
		   return this list to main
		   
		   create another function to find mean marks of maths for the class
		   create another function to find lowest and the highest marks
		   create another function to find standard deviation in marks
		   create another function to find mode of marks 
		   
arbitrary functions
-----------------------
we can take anything or everything

exception handling
-------------------------------
error that python gives whenever something went wrong. let it be from user input or user action or may be system resources.
every exception has 2 parts 
1. name of an exception
2. description of an exception


in python we have 4 blocks to handle exception
