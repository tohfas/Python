functions
-----------------------------
are peice of code that can be reused again and again.
to make our code more modular, readable and organised
it is easy to debug the code if we define functions

def is a key word for defining functions


Question :- write a program of guessing game. create function in which you need to check 
            if a number entered by user is odd and between 2 and 20 then you the game otherwise you get max 3 chances 
			to win the game. At any point of time you give right number, you win and program should not ask another number
			do not return success or failure from the function, instead print success or failure in main.
			
Question :- write a menu driven program to find sum, multiply, divide, subtract
            menu should be displayed what operation you want, invoke the specific method sum, multiply, divide, subtract
			and find answers. if user says to recompute as two numbers again and show menu again for calculations
			if user say terminate, it should terminate the program
			
		
lambda functions
-----------------
they are also called as anonomous functions
they are made to achieve small tasks
the return type of a lambda function is a function
we cannot have control flow statements like if else while for etc in lambda functions
the are single line functions. we cannot write in multiple lines

syntax

fun_name = lambda input_arguments : return_value
