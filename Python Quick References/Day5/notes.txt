exception handling
------------------------
how to raise an exception manually - by two keywords
raise - raises an exception without checking any condition
assert - checks the condition and raises an exception
       - we can give conditional messages with assert 
	   - it is better than raise
	   - raises an exception (AssertionError) when the condition is false
	   - do not raises an exception when the condition is true
	   
# take an input from the user credit card number and check following things
# 1. card number should be of exact 16 digits
# 2. card number should not contain small case letters
# 3. card number should not contain upper case letters
# 4. card number should not contain special chars
# 5. card number should not contain spaced
# 6. card number should contain only digits
# 7. card number should not start with 0
# 8. Sum of digits of card number should be even
# use exception handling while writing code

Object Oriented programming
---------------------------------------------------------------
deal with real time entities as classes
car - as a class 
    - characterstics of a car like number of tyres, color of seat, color of car, number of mirrors etc are called attributes
	- attributes are variables/ methods(functions) defined in a class
	- class is also called as blueprint
	- from the same class we can have multiple objects 
	- object is an instance of a class
	- all the objects work independently on different memory addresses
	- object variables are prefixed with self. and they are attached to an object
	- whereever this object will go the object variable will also go
	
write a program to take radius as input in a constructor
area method should print area 
perimeter method should return perimeter to main


write a program to take input in constructor from the user names in a list till user enters None
in another method check the name of maximum length (having max number of characters)
in another method find the ASCII value of first and last letter of name

public - accessible in class as well as inherited classes and also in main
protected - accessible in class as well as inherited classes but not in main
          - in python we can access protected variables in main for debugging purposes
		  - they are prefixed with single underscore
private - accessible only in a class and not in main as well not in inherited classes. 
          they are hidden from the main program
		  we can access them in main for debugging purposes.
		  they are prefixed with double underscore __
		  
inheritance means inheriting the properties of base class in derived class
if the method name is same in base and derived class, derived class gets the priority
