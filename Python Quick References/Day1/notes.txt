why python is so popular
-----------------------------
1. open source - in unix and linux machines python is pre installed
2. easy in syntax and more like english language
3. number of lines of code in python is 1/3 the lines of code we write in java or c++
4. machine learning capabalities - subset of AI  which is all about predictive analysis
   sklearn - library which is having all the algorithms of machine learning
   is good for 2 dimentional data - table, spred sheet
5 because of the major libararies python picked up its importance
  pandas - for data analytics
  numpy - for numerical analysis - playing with numbers 
  matplotlib - for plotting graphs
  seaborn - for plotting graphs
  boto3 - connecting to AWS server
  Tkinter - developing front end applications
  tensorflow/ Keras - deep learning - subset of ML which is more handy in terms of 3 dimentional data predictions
  feature selection is automatic in deep learning but in ML it is manual
  
  humidity/ rainfall/ temp / farmer age/ ph calls farmer make in a day => independent vars
  crop yield -> dependent var

Rules to work on python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
case sensitive programming language - all keywords like print, while for if else etc are in small case
we dont have to declare datatypes in python - it automatically understands the datatype
we cannot write anything anywhere in python. we need to write code from 0th column of editor.
if we write any block like if else while for etc then give one tab to signnify its body
there ways of giving comments in python
-----------------------
strings can be enlosed in "" or ''

in ver 2.x of python 

input() - takes by default integers and floats
raw_input() - takes by default strings

in ver 3.x only one function is there i.e input() - which takes strings by default
major version (2 to 3) compatability is not there in python 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
strings can be enlcosed in " " or ' '
in clause checks the subsring is a part of string or not
strings are immutable in python - we cannot change the contents of a string once defined.
but when you assign a new string to the original string, memory address get changed and we can change the whole string
strings are sequentially stored in memory starting from 0th index
