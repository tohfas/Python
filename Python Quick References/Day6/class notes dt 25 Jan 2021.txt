pandas -> for data analytics
       -> read and write data from any of the external sources
	   
two data structures 
1. series - contains single dimentional data like lists but they are more flexible as compared to lists
          - in series we can define our own user defined index
2. data frames - contains two dimentional data in form of rows and columns
                 every row has unique row id called index starting from 0
				 every column has unique name starting from 0
				 index determines which values will go in series
				 
in pandas missing values are called NaN -> not a applicable value or missing value
if you create data frame from dictionary, column headings will be keys of dictionary

we can read data from any of the external sources like csv file or excel sheet
there are 3 basic datatypes of any column in data frame
1. integer - if all int values are there column is read out as int, if there is missing value, it will read out as 
             float 
2. float - if there are decimal values in a column it will read out as float
3. object - if column has strings that column is read out as an object

3 important things that you must do when you read data in data frame
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. df.types - to see data types of each column
2. df.columns - may be at the time of reading column has leading or trailing spaces.
3. df.shape - tell you number rows Vs no of column

how to filter the data from data frame
-----------------------------------------
df['col name'] -> we give [] when column name has some spaces
df.col_name -> we give when column name has no spaces

df[(condition1) & (condition2) | (condition3)] -> all the conditions have to be in ()

from the dataframe if you want to filter multiple columns give [[  ]]


Numpy - is a library for numerical analysis  
      - if we want to solve any kind of mathematical or statistical problems we use numpy
	  - it has got concept of arrays 
	  
2x+3y-4z=10
4x+6y-8z=20
4x-7y+8z=30
